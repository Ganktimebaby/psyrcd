Psyrcd is a pure-python IRC server that only requires the standard library.
It ought to run anywhere python (>=2.5) runs.

To accept SSL connections you will need to install the PyOpenSSL package.

Psyrcd is novel in that it permits the development of new commands while it's running.
To enable this you will need the Mako templating system installed (http://makotemplates.org/).

So far it's only been tested on Linux 2.6 with Python 2.7.
