Psyrcd is a pure-python IRC server that only requires the standard library.
It ought to run anywhere python (>=2.5) runs.

To accept SSL connections you will need to install the PyOpenSSL package.

It currently supports a simple scripting system via mako (http://makotemplates.org)
This will be extended in future to cover the creation of novel channel modes.

So far it's only been tested on Linux 2.6 with Python 2.7.
